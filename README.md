# TheNasdaq12
A Python tool that assesses stocks based on the Nasdaq Dozen indicators. Each stock receive a score out of 12. 

As someone who recently started investing in the stock market, I realized that there's no proper application that helps investors assess stocks. I mean yeah, you'll find thousands of websites that will tell you what makes a stock good and what makes a stock bad but there are 2 problems that I found:

1) There's simply way too much information out there. Some websites tell you one thing while others tell you another thing. In this vast collection of information, how does one know exactly which source is the most reliable.
2) There seems to be an infinite number of indicators you can look at when assessing a stock. How do we know which indicators are more important than others?

Enter The Nasdaq Dozen. It seems like Nasdaq, the second largest stock market in the world, was able to understand the struggles of being a beginner investor. So, a few years back, they released an article on their official website called 'The Nasdaq Dozen.' 'The Nasdaq Dozen is essentially 12 important indicators to help you assess stocks.

This Python program simply automates the process of assessing stocks based on the Nasdaq Dozen indicators. The program takes in a stock ticker as input and then displays which indicators the stock succesfully passed, and which indicators it failed.
